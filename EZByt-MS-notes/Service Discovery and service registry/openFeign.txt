
How to use OpenFeign =>

1) add dependency

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
	</dependency>

2) Eneable it by mentioning an anotation on main class
	=> @EnableFeignClients
	


============================================================================
Now to connect with other ms we can create the interface and mark it with @FeignClient to call services of other ms

Note =>
1. name of microservices should correct
2. path should be correct and full
3. method signeture should same as mentioned in the consuming microservice



@FeignClient("cards")		// microservices name in config server
public interface CardsFeignClient {

    @GetMapping(value = "/api/fetch",consumes = "application/json")		// we need to give full path 
    public ResponseEntity<CardsDto> fetchCardDetails(@RequestParam String mobileNumber);	// method signeture should be match

}	


By using this we can fetch the data from other services ,
In controller add method to fetch data , and you are all done , we can fetch data from other microservice.
