
Postgres =>
docker run --name postgres1 -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=username -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres

docker login => to login using shell
docker images => show all docker images avilable
docker inspect image image_Id => show all details of the image
docker run -p 8080:8080 iamgename:tagname => to run docker image on specific port and map it to our system port (but by this approch we cant run multiple instances in cmd at a time )
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 iamgename:tagname => this will run docker image in dettached mode so we can run multiple instances with same cmd
docker container pause conatinerId => pause container
docker container unpause containerId=> unpause container
docker container stop containerId => stop container
docker conatainer kill containerId => kill container
docker container restart containerId => to restart container
docker container inspect containerId => to inspect container
docker satrt conatinerId => this will start image instance created priviously and then stoped 
docker ps => to list down all instances 
docker stop instance-name => to stop instance
docker exec -it instance-name bash => to go inside instance
docker image rm image_id => to remove docker image , we can remove multiple images at a time by sepreating them with coma
docker build . -t userid/imagename:tagname => to build image

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
docker container logs containerId => to fetch logs  
docker container logs -f containerId => to follow log output
docker rm conatinerId => to remove conatiner
docker container purne => to remove all stoped conainers
docker image push container_registry/username:tag = push to remote repo
docker image pull container_registry/username:tag = pull from remote repo
docker image purn => remover all unused images
docker container stats => all container stats
docker system purn => remover stoped container, dangling images, unused networks, volumes and cache
docker rmi imageId => remove image 
docker login -u username => to login in docker hub 
docker logout => logout from docker hub
docker history imageName => see all intermediate command executed while building image
docker exec -it containerID sh => to open shell inside running container and execute commands
docker compose up => to up docker compose
docker compose down => to down and delete container open by using compose
-------------------------------------------
8080(Port in system):8080(port in docker)
we can give it as
8080:8080
8081:8080
8082:8080
docker has isolated enviroment for each container so we can run multiple instance on same port 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

its not good practice to store images localy so we are pusshing it to docker hub by some commands

docker image push docker.io/username/imagename:tagname
eg. docker image push docker.io/akashaher/accounts:s4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to pull images from repo to local
docker pull usernave/imagename:tagname
eg. docker pull akashaher/cards:s4
